# kookiepkgs

Basically [`nixpkgs`] but in less cool.
It contains a bunch of software, configuration and tools that fit into my workflow.
I upstream quite a lot of stuff to `nixpkgs`,
everything in this repo is essentially useless for anyone but me (and maybe friends).

[`nixpkgs`]: https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs

If you feel like contributing, make sure your efforts wouldn't 
be more suitable for `nixpkgs` directly.

Following is a list of all the things in this repo
